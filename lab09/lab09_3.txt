Exercise 1:

Whatâ€™s the size of the cats/dogs datasets?
	3000 images, 1500 for each species

How does the first convnet compare with the one we did in class.
	This album goes through more convuluting than our in class example, though that probably is because we are working with much larger images.

Can you see any interesting patterns in the intermediate representations?
	It's actualy the cat that seems to be filtered out, but I assume the model can then look at what is ommitted to find what it's looking for.

Exercise 2:

What is data augmentation?
	Manipulating data to multiply the number of units to test against. Running transformations on images is a good example.

Report your best results and the hyperparameters you used to get them.

loss: 0.4800
	history = model.fit_generator(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=100,
      epochs=30,
      validation_data=validation_generator,
      validation_steps=50,
      verbose=2)
      
A couple of rounds of tweaking parameters did not gain better results at the final epoch, though I did get down to 0.43 during one epoch.
