Why are we regularizing with respect to sparsity?
	We want to increase the effeciency of our model and avoid overfitting.

How does L1 regularization increase sparsity?
	By filtering out weights (setting them to 0) that are not effective in finding a solution.

Task 1: Here, just report the best log loss value / model size you can get and what gamma value you used to get them.

I used 0.7 for my reulation strength and obtained a LogLoss of 0.26.
