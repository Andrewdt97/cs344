How does the linear regression approach to the problem fare?
It doesn't seem to do a bad job per se, but it does not punish false positives enough per my understanding.

Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.
	LogLoss punishes confidence errors more heavily. There is more distinction between negative and posititive predictions.
Task 2: Explain how the logistic regression fares compared to the linear regression.
	It's hard for me to do a direct comparison because they measure loss differently. LogLoss comes up with a higher number for error, which is probably more accurate when dealing with our 0<=loss<=1 scale.

Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.
linear_classifier = train_linear_classifier_model(
    learning_rate=0.0000005,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=20,
    ...)
   Validation set AUC: 0.59
   Validation AUC: 0.76
