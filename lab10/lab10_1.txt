Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?
I feel like I have a hard time answering this question. Our examples using Keras thus far have far less code than do our TF examples. I like this ease of use, but I have no idea how much of that is down the Keras's preformatted data. On a custom dataset, it might be just as much work to get it running.

Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.

Task 1: The following modified solution code got a RMSE on the validation set of 100.7

dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=2000,
    batch_size=100,
    hidden_units=[32, 10],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

Task 2:
The model generated from above has a RMSE of 100.61
