Entropy(Hungry?) = - (7/12 * lg(7/12)) + (5/12 * lg(5/12))
	= - (-0.4536 - 0.5263)
	= 0.9799
Remainder(Hungry?)
	= 7/12 * Entropy(5/7, 2/7)
	= 7/12 * (- (5/7 * lg(5/7) + 2/7 * lg(2/7)))
	= 7/12 * (- (-0.8631)
	= 0.5035

Gain(Hungry?) = 0.9799 - 0.5035 = 0.4764

This would make it a better indicator of WillWait than both patrons and type.
