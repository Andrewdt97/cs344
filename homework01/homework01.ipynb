    "1. My gut reaction was theat introspection would not be very helpful for thinking about AI, but as I consulted my limited knowledge bank of AI (a bit of introspection), I realize it is used a lot for machine learning. If you can inform an AI what it's goals are and teach it how to adjust it's approach to meet it's goal, and teach it how to reflect on it's actions (introspection), then it can improve itself. In machine learning, I know they let they AI preform linear regression to try and minimize the margin of error for a given problem.\n",
