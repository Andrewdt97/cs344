Compare and contrast Seaborn vs. MatPlotLib.
Both libraries enable data visualization, but while MPL seems to give highly customizable  and basic graphic, seaborn has lots of support for complex data analysis.

How big is this dataset and does it seem of an appropriate size for this problem?
We have a data set with 397 entries. I think it will do the job for a simple cause-effect prediction like this one, but for anything more complex, it might struggle. 

Explain what the prescribed normalization of the data does.
Normalizing data helps the model use data measured on different scales more effectively.

Is this an example of a linear regression model?
Yes. We use a linear activation function across our input data.

In their conclusion, they claim that smaller datasets “prefer” smaller networks. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
I would agree. While a bigger network can give more exact predictions, they are prone to just memorizing inputs. This results in overfitting, which we don't want. In other words, we want a system that is smart, but not one that is too smart.
