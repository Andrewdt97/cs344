Compare and contrast categorical vs numerical data
Categorical data is data that fits into lables such as the make of a car. Numerical data is a number, so like the price of a vehicle.

Submit solutions to tasks 1–2. Include your best hyper-parameter values and the resulting RMSE, but not the training output.
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.0001,
    steps=150,
    batch_size=2
)

Final RMSE (on training data): 168.84

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.0001,
    steps=250,
    batch_size=2,
    input_feature='population'
)
Final RMSE (on training data): 175.95

What are the hyper-parameters learned in these exercises and is there a “standard” tuning algorithm for them?
Learning rate: The rate at which the prediction line is updated
Steps: The total number of steps of readjustment
Batch size: The size of the batches passed to the model

There is no standard tuning for them. They are highly dependant on the data passed in to them.
