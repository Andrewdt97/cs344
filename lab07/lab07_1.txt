Why would one use Pandas rather than the standard data manipulation features provided by NumPy?
Pandas gives easy access to data in a table format with easy access and manipulation over all of the data.
Under what circumstances would it be useful to reorder/shuffle a Pandas DataFrame?
If you have large amounts of data, a good sort can save time accessing based on the index. Also being able to view your data is different orders can be helpful to see trends.
